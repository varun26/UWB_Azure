# Samples for the Azure IoT device SDK for Python

This folder contains simple samples showing how to use the various features of the Microsoft Azure IoT Hub service from a device running Python.

## Code

* iothub_client_anchorList.py is the code in python2.7 to display the list of UWB anchors in a network.

And if you are looking for end to end samples that show how to do simple analytics and processing of the data generated by your device using Azure services such as Stream Analytics, Big Data, Machine Learning and others, check out our [E2E samples gallery](http://aka.ms/azureiotsamples).

## How to run the samples
In order to run the device samples you will first need the following prerequisites:
* [Setup your development environment][devbox-setup]
> Note: On Windows, it is recommended to install the **iothub-client** module package using pip (see link above).
* [Create an Azure IoT Hub instance][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
* [Create a device identity for your device][lnk-manage-iot-hub] and retrieve the primary connection string for this device

* Run the sample application using the following command to run the simple sample (replacing `<device connection string>` with the one generated previously):
    ```
	python iothub_client_anchorList.py 
    ```
